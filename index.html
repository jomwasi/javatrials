    <h1> GHANIAN NAMING SYSTEM</h1>
    <p> Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture.<br>
        <aside>
        Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name'which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.
        Most people do not know when their birthdays are, but some might not know what day of the week they were born.Luckily for us, there are ways to calculate the day of the week from a specific date.<br> 
        </aside> </p>
       <p>The following is one of the many methods that exist for that;</p>

    <form> 
        <label for="date"> Date of Birth</label>
        <input type="date" id="Date">
    <selct name="gender" id="gender">
         <select name="gender" id="gender"> 
            <OPTion value="male ">male</OPTion>
            <option value="female">female</option>
        </select>
        <button type="button" onclick="submit()" value>submit</button>
</selct>
