        Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first names as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.<br>
        Most people do not know when their birthdays are, but some might not know what day of the week they were born.<br>Luckily for us, there are ways to calculate the day of the week from a specific date.<br>
